<h1>My heading</h1>

<p>This is the first section of my document</p>
<p>I'll add another paragraph here too.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Here is</li>
    <li>a list for</li>
    <li>you to read</li>
</ol>
<h2>My subheading</h2>
<p>This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to find this content</p>
<h2>My 2nd subheading</h2>
<p>This is the second subsection of my content. I think this is more interesting than the last one</p>

<button data-message="This is from the first button">Click me!</button>
<button data-message="This is from the second button">Click me too!</button>
<button data-message="This is from the third button">And me!</button>

<h1 class="paramount-heading">Semantic Markup</h1>
<article class="article">
    <p class="paragraph">This should be a paragraph</p>
    <a class="anchor-tag">This should be an anchor tag</a>
    <button class="button">This should be a button</button>
</article>

1. The snippet is not semantic because it uses the div tag.
2. Accessibility to me means that a web program can be used by a wide range of people and devices.
